# Flight Data

## This is an API to get data for the airports, runways, navaids and etc.

## Airports

### base URL: */api/v1/airports*

**End Points**:

Get All Airports:\
Example: ***/api/v1/airports/all-airports***

Get Airports By ICAO:\
Example: ***/api/v1/airports/icao/cywg***

Get Airports By IATA:\
Example: ***/api/v1/airports/iata/ywg***

Get Airports By Type (large_airport, medium_airport, small_airport,heliport,seaplane_base,closed_airport)\
Example: ***/api/v1/airports/type/heliport***

Get Airports By Name (Able to partially match e.g. winnipeg would match 3 results)\
Example: ***/api/v1/airports/name/Winnipeg***

Get airports within certain radius (km for kilometers, nm or nautical miles )\
Example: ***/api/v1/airports/airports-within/icao/katl/distance/30/unit/nm***

Get distance between origin airport and destination airport (km for kilometers, nm or nautical miles)\
Example: ***/api/v1/airports/airports-distance/origin/katl/destination/kjax/unit/nm***

Sort METARs by visibility from worst to best:\
Example: ***/api/v1/airports/continent-weather/visibility/na?sort=1&limit=10***

Sort METARs by barometers from lowest to highest:\
Example: ***/api/v1/airports/continent-weather/baro/sa?sort=1&limit=10***

Sort METARs by wind speed from highest to lowest:\
Example: ***/api/v1/airports/continent-weather/wind-speed/oc?limit=10***

Sort METARs by wind gust speed from highest to lowest:\
Example: ***/api/v1/airports/country-weather/wind-gust-speed/na?limit=10***

### Bad Weathers For Country

#### Base URL:  */api/v1/weather/country-weather*

**End Points**:

Sort METARs by temperature from lowest to highest:\
Example: ***/api/v1/airports/country-weather/temperature/ca?sort=1&limit=10***

Sort METARs by visibility from worst to best:\
Example: ***/api/v1/airports/country-weather/visibility/us?sort=1&limit=10***

Sort METARs by barometers from lowest to highest:\
Example: ***/api/v1/airports/country-weather/baro/ca?sort=1&limit=10***

Sort METARs by wind speed from highest to lowest:\
Example: ***/api/v1/airports/country-weather/wind-speed/ca?limit=10***

Sort METARs by wind gust speed from highest to lowest:\
Example: ***/api/v1/airports/country-weather/wind-gust-speed/ca?limit=10***

### Users: */api/v1/users*

**End Points**:

Signup: \
Example: ***/api/v1/users/signup***

Login:\
Example: ***/api/v1/users/login***

### Additional Features

METAR: Decoded + Raw METAR

ATIS: FAA published and Vatsim (if they are available)

Weather: List worst weather for selected country.

### ToDo List:

* ~~Commentary system to allow user to add comment to airport, such like videos, airport remark, landing performances
  and
  etc.~~
* ~~ILS~~
* ~~ATIS~~
* NOTAM

* ~~Get Airports by Weather filter~~

* Geo data:
    * ~~Nearby airports from selected airport~~
    * ~~Distance between origin airports to destination airport(approximate ground distance)~~
    * *Distance between origin airports to destination airport (approximate air distance)
* ~~Protected Routes~~

* Zibo Updates Download (Patch Only, Azure CDN if time allowed)

* DB modification with Admin authorization.

* *Navigraph Navdata parser to update the Airports DB. DB Size reduce.

* Add Navigraph integration to allow registered user to access more data.

* Vatsim data display

    * Online regions
    * ~~ATIS~~

*Require complete DB model and controllers refactor

*Need waypoints coordinates to preform graph search
